# Better-Vanilla-Cream
Makes your Vanilla Minecraft experience for Fabric better. These are client-side! You wont get banned on any servers. There are many features that are just small and compact, that make your live easier. Maybe in your survival world. Or a server you are on. BVC just adds simple useful (probably) features. Such as RightClick harvest, or auto-sorting for your inventory. Maybe inviting your friends into your world without knowing any server-knowledge, would interest you? Or, well... Better performance than OptiFine :) All while not breaking any vanilla-mechanics.
